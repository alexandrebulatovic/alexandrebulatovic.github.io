This project's goal was to create an Android native application executing a list of tasks given by our teacher.

The first task was to parse a XML file on the internet using its URL and retrieve information in XML elements regarding images to download in cache. We then had to display these pictures to the user in a menu.

The app had to be well-designed (with an aesthetic UI) and easy to use. In terms of features, the user had to be able to select a picture and zoom in and out using his fingers, if he wanted to.


The work was done with [Abdel Ait Abdelloili.](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/ait-abdelloili)

**Skills :**
- using Java language with Android Studio IDE
- parsing a XML file given its URL to retrieve data
- storage of images in phone's cache
- using a menu to browse between the different pictures and allow for selection of a picture
- creating a view allowing to zoom in and out of the picture by using your fingers ("pinching")
- using [Material Design de Google](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_design) components while keeping the backward compatibility for older devices

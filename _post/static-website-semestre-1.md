This project's aim was to put into practice our learning from primer Web development class's.
Our target audience was high school graduates thinking about pursuing their studies in computer science at the University Institute of Technology of Montpellier. 
The website's content is therefore a summary of our school's curriculum. The website was made as a team of four.


**Skills :**
- using HTML and CSS programming languages
- using forms (without server-side code, the "Send" button was only displaying a new HTML page faking the sending)
- embedding Youtube videos
- web design

This project is a level up from our [first static website]({%link _post/static-website-semestre-1.md %}).
The goal was to create a functional website for e-commerce needs, excluding the payment processing and TLS/SSL layer, putting into practice what we learned in our server-side courses with PHP.

With my colleague, Jordan Barral, we chose cell phones as our products.

**Skills :**
- using HTML and CSS programming languages for front-end, PHP as back-end
- using MySQL database for data persistence (users, products and orders)
- using forms with GET/POST variables to transfer data
- using COOKIE and SESSION variables to remember user's data
- securing the website by redirecting the user to an error page if he hacks the URL (the query string part)
- creating SQL queries needed to make the website operational
- creating an appriopriate database schema according to what we need to persist
- using a MVC architecture with controllers, models and view

# About me

[Here is my resume.](Alexander_Bulatovic_Java_developer.pdf)

I am a currently working as a junior Java developer in Avignon, France. I graduated in Computer Science from the University Institute of Technology of Montpellier in 2017 after my internship at one of the Sanofi R&D centers in Montpellier.

After that I did a gap year learning about banking and finance, especially how the financial markets operate. I started investing in cryptocurrencies in 2018 while learning about technical analysis and then went on learning about capital markets and leaving cryptocurrencies behind, gradually learned about financial analysis and other factors driving markets. I keep up to date with the world news almost everyday as I am currently investing in the US and European stock markets, using options for hedging/leverage or plain stocks.

Teaching myself involved doing the [ITPM](https://www.itpm.com/) Professional FOREX Trading Masterclass which teaches how to generate Macro driven trade ideas on currencies but also risk management, TA, and some other tools (performance ratios, how to build a watchlist spreadsheet...) and I have also done the Economics of Money and Banking online course from Columbia University which teaches the history of money and banking system with a focus on the United States, and the Business and Financial Modeling Specialization online course from Wharton Online (online division of Wharton Business School) which helps build Excel models to assess a business' profitability or for decision-making related to financial investments.

I am presently working for a life insurance outsource provider. My employer manages life insurance portfolios for insurers who want to focus more on the product development and innovation. Our clients include the European largest insurer and some other French leading insurers.

Here is a list of the IT skills I presently use:  
**Programming languages** : Java 8, PL/SQL and SQL  
**Frameworks** : Spring Batch, Spring Data, Spring Boot, Spring MVC (only for RESTful Web Services), Hibernate  
**Infrastructure** : Apache Kafka, Docker, Jenkins  

I am open to opportunities in London (my preference) or Paris and I would like to work with people involved in the finance industry (wealth management or portfolio management).
